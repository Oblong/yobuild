# See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=636134 for why some people disable --disable-deinterlace in universal builds...
# Rather than do that, let's build twice and lipo them together.
# Pass --disable-cairo because we don't build that yet, but we do build fontconfig, and mixing
# system with nonsystem is bad.
# Disable examples because they use system gtk/qt, which doesn't link properly against yobuild glib (which is too new)
