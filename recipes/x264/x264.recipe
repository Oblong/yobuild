# On Mac, x264 gets its install name slightly wrong.
# We could fix it like this:
#is_mac() {
#    test -f /usr/bin/sw_vers
#}
#if is_mac
#then
#    export YB_DEFAULT_BUILD_PRE_PACKAGE_HOOK="install_name_tool -id \$PREFIX/lib/libx264.138.dylib \$DESTDIR\$PREFIX/lib/libx264.138.dylib"
#fi
#
# but I chose to fix it with a patch; see patches/x264-final-install-name.patch
